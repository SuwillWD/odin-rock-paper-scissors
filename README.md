Welcome to this project! This is project from the foundational course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). It implements a simple and classic game of [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) with computer. It also has a round system in it, in which a player can play a game of multiple rounds and at last winner is declared. This project is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
